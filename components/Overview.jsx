        Even as a little kid, I've always liked to problem solve. I would always try to optimize everything I did ranging from trying to get as much gold as I could on a mobile game to finding the
        best way to do my chores. Because of my problem-solving nature, I was naturally drawn to math and science, and in turn, computer science became a major interest of mine.

        Along with my interest in math and science, I also developed an appreciation of creating art from a young age. I enjoy creating intricate paintings or visually appealing graphic designs on
        Photoshop. Since I have a passion for both art and computer science, I feel like I can view problems from a different perspective than most people. I will be able to form creative solutions
        because I have spent time in both fields along with their limitations.
